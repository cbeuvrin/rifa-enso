/* Previous spin moves UP (translateY negative). To land, we want the final strip to slide DOWN into place? 
   Actually, slots usually spin DOWN (symbols fall). My previous spin was `translateY(-50%)` which moves items UP.
   Let's stick to UP movement for consistency.
   Spin: Moves from 0 to -50% (items go UP).
   Landing: Should start at 0 (or slight offset) and ease out to final position.
   Wait, if spin moves UP, the "next" symbols come from BELOW.
   So Landing should start with result symbols BELOW view, and slide UP into view.
